Apache Nutch 1.10 plugin development template for IntelliJ IDEA.

To make this work please copy your working Nutch installation into the
nutch-1.10 subdirectory and add plugin name to nutch-plugin-development-template
to plugin.includes configuration directive.

Then just execute the "Parse test data" debug configuration.

Please explore files of the project to understand what's going on. There's not
so much of them.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this project.
