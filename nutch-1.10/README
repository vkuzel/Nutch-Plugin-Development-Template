Place your Apache Nutch 1.10 installation into this directory. So content of
this directory is going to look like this:

conf
lib
plugins
test_data.zip <-- Don't remove this file. It contains some data to test plugin on.

You are not going to need bin directory since IDEA calls Nutch's classes
directly. Don't forget to add nutch-plugin-development-template to Nutch's
plugin.includes configuration directive
